# Color Palette

- Background
  - Color: #0A0C10
  - Role: Primary background
  - Notes: Near-black with a subtle cool undertone to add depth and reduce harsh contrast compared to pure black.
- Headings
  - Color: #E9CFA4
  - Role: Project titles and primary headings
  - Notes: Warm, light-infused tone to enhance large display typography and create strong visual hierarchy.
- Body Text
  - Color: #D1CDC4
  - Role: Primary descriptive text
  - Notes: Warm neutral optimized for readability on dark backgrounds while remaining visually subordinate to headings.
- Secondary Text
  - Color: #8E8A80
  - Role: Metadata, secondary descriptions
  - Notes: Reduced contrast to reinforce hierarchy without sacrificing legibility.
- Accent
  - Color: #B0483A
  - Role: Interactive states (hover, focus), highlights, separators
  - Notes: Used sparingly to introduce rhythm and emphasis without becoming decorative.
- Contrast Strategy
  - High contrast reserved for headings
  - Medium contrast for body text
  - Low contrast for secondary information
  - Accent color never used for long-form text
- Accessibility
  - Text colors selected to maintain comfortable contrast on dark backgrounds
  - Avoids pure white to reduce eye strain
  - Hierarchy enforced through tone, not color saturation
- Usage Constraints
  - No large background areas using accent color
  - No gradients or neon hues
  - Palette intended to support typography, not compete with it
