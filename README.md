Typography System

🎯 Intent & Motivation

The typographic system is intentionally minimal and role-driven.
Rather than relying on a single versatile typeface, the system separates expression from information.

Display typography is used to introduce each project as a strong visual statement, while a neutral text typeface ensures clarity and continuity. This contrast allows projects to “sell themselves” visually without compromising readability or structure.

🔠 Stardom — Titles

Role: Expression, identity, visual impact
Used for: Project titles only

Why Stardom

Stardom is a display serif designed for extreme large sizes. Its exaggerated proportions and sharp triangular serifs give each title a sculptural, almost graphic presence.

Instead of being treated as a reading typeface, Stardom is used deliberately as a visual element, framing each project as a bold, self-contained piece. Its limited scope reinforces intentionality and avoids overuse.

Key reasons for choosing it:
	•	Strong contemporary character
	•	Distinct triangular serif forms
	•	Designed specifically for large-scale usage
	•	Helps differentiate projects visually

🔡 Satoshi — Descriptions

Role: Clarity, readability, structure
Used for: Project descriptions

Why Satoshi

Satoshi is a modern sans-serif with balanced proportions and a subtle human tone. It provides a neutral foundation that complements the expressive nature of Stardom without competing for attention.

Its legibility at small and medium sizes makes it ideal for short descriptive texts, ensuring that project summaries remain clear and accessible.

Key reasons for choosing it:
	•	Excellent screen readability
	•	Neutral but not cold
	•	Pairs naturally with a strong display serif
	•	Suitable for modern web interfaces

🧱 System Summary
This pairing creates a clear visual hierarchy:
	•	Stardom establishes identity and impact
	•	Satoshi supports understanding and flow

🧠 Closing Rationale

By limiting each typeface to a specific role, the system remains focused and intentional. Stardom brings character and presence to each project, while Satoshi ensures that supporting information is easy to read and visually calm.

The result is a portfolio that feels confident, editorial, and purpose-driven—where typography supports the content rather than overwhelming it.
